# LLM Cold Email Generator for Small Enterprises

### Overview
This repository hosts an LLM-powered solution aimed at helping **small enterprises** reach out to **big client companies** through **cold emails** offering **human resources** and project-based services. 

By leveraging open-source **Llama 3.1** (via **GroqCloud**) and a **ChromaDB**-backed vector store, this application intelligently generates personalized cold emails. These emails reference the **skills required** by large organizations, as listed on their job portals, and match them to the **relevant portfolios** of small enterprises. The goal is to position small companies as a flexible, cost-efficient alternative to hiring full-time employees, offering on-demand expertise to fulfill project needs.

## Key Features
- **Automated Cold Email Generation**: Generate tailored emails to send to large companies based on job listings.
- **Intelligent Skill Matching**: The LLM identifies the required skills from the client company's job portal and matches them to the portfolios of small enterprises.
- **LLM-Powered Contextual Awareness**: The system understands the job requirements and crafts emails with a natural, professional tone.
- **Efficient Workforce Offerings**: Helps small businesses pitch themselves as an agile and cost-effective alternative to hiring full-time staff.
  
## How It Works
1. **Job Portal Scraping**: The application extracts job requirements from client companies' public job portals or project listings.
2. **Portfolio Matching**: Using **ChromaDB** to store vectors of small enterprises' portfolios, the app finds the best-matching portfolios according to the required skills.
3. **Cold Email Generation**: A contextual email is generated using the **Llama 3.1** model running on **GroqCloud**, tailored to the specific job listing and the matched portfolio.

## Tech Stack
- **GroqCloud**: Cloud platform running **open-source Llama 3.1**, providing a scalable environment for real-time processing.
- **ChromaDB**: A powerful vector database used for storing and retrieving skill and portfolio vectors, enabling fast and efficient portfolio matching.
- **Open-Source LLM**: Based on Llama 3.1, fine-tuned to understand job descriptions and portfolios to generate professional emails with high relevance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLM-Cold-Email-Generator.git
   cd LLM-Cold-Email-Generator
   ```

4. **Configure the Environment:**
   Update the `.env` file with necessary API keys and configurations:
   ```bash
   GROQCLOUD_API_KEY=<your-groqcloud-api-key>
   ```

5. **Run the Application using streamlit:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## Usage

   The generated email will contain:
   - A professional introduction
   - The key skills and services offered by the small enterprise
   - A reference to the job requirements, showcasing the portfolio match
   - A call to action for further communication or collaboration

## Example Workflow
1. The user scrapes a job listing from a major client company's portal that requires skills in **Data Science and Cloud Engineering**.
2. The system matches the requirements to a small enterprise that specializes in these fields.
3. A custom cold email is generated, highlighting the company's expertise in the exact areas needed by the client.
